# About the Pattern: Fast and Slow Pointers

Similar to the **two pointers** pattern, the **fast and slow pointers** pattern uses two pointers to traverse an iterable data structure, but at **different speeds**. It is often used to detect cycles or find specific targets.

While the two pointers technique focuses on comparing data values, the fast and slow pointers method is typically used to **analyze the structure or properties** of the data.

---

## Key Idea

- **Both pointers start at the same position**.
- **Slow pointer** moves **one step** at a time.
- **Fast pointer** moves **two steps** at a time.
- Because of the speed difference, if a cycle exists, **the two pointers will eventually meet** during traversal.

This method is also known as the **Hare and Tortoise algorithm**:

- **Hare** = fast pointer
- **Tortoise** = slow pointer

**Analogy:** Imagine two runners on a circular track starting at the same point. The faster runner will eventually overtake the slower one — this is how the method detects cycles.

### Common Uses

- Detecting cycles in linked lists.
- Finding the midpoint of a linked list.
- Identifying intersections in linked lists.
- Detecting patterns in circular arrays.

### Pseudocode Template

```plaintext
FUNCTION fastAndSlow(dataStructure):
  # Initialize pointers (or indices)
  fastPointer = dataStructure.start   # or 0 if array
  slowPointer = dataStructure.start   # or 0 if array

  WHILE fastPointer != null AND fastPointer.next != null:
    # For arrays: WHILE fastPointer < dataStructure.length
    # AND (fastPointer + 1) < dataStructure.length:

    slowPointer = slowPointer.next
    # For arrays: slowPointer = slowPointer + 1

    fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next
    # For arrays: fastPointer = fastPointer + 2

    IF fastPointer != null AND someCondition(fastPointer, slowPointer):
      # For arrays: use someCondition(dataStructure[fastPointer], dataStructure[slowPointer])
      handleCondition(fastPointer, slowPointer)
      BREAK

  # Process the result
  processResult(slowPointer)
  # For arrays: processResult(dataStructure[slowPointer])
```

## Real-World Problems

### 1. Symlink Verification

Imagine you’re an IT administrator maintaining a large server. In one directory, multiple files and symbolic links (symlinks) point to other files or symlinks.  
Occasionally, a misconfiguration might create a loop — e.g., **symlink A points to B, and B eventually links back to A**.  
This creates a cycle where following the symlinks never ends.

A **fast and slow pointer** approach helps detect such loops:

- **Tortoise**: follows links one step at a time.
- **Hare**: jumps two steps.
- If they ever land on the same file/link again → **cycle detected**.

---

### 2. Compiling an Object-Oriented Program

During compilation, each object-oriented module may depend on others. Sometimes a loop occurs — e.g., **module A depends on B, and B depends on A**.

Using **fast and slow pointers**:

- **Tortoise**: moves one module at a time.
- **Hare**: jumps two modules.
- If they meet → **cyclic dependency exists**.

This method provides a **quick, space-efficient check** to detect and resolve loops, ensuring a clean compilation sequence.

## Where to Use This Solution

### Suitable Data Structures

- **Linear data structures**: arrays, linked lists, strings.

### Ideal Problem Types

- **Cycle or intersection detection**:  
  Detecting loops in a linked list or array, or finding intersections between two structures.
- **Finding the starting element of the second quantile**:  
  Identifying the element where the second part of a dataset begins — e.g., the **midpoint** of an array or linked list marking the start of the second half.
